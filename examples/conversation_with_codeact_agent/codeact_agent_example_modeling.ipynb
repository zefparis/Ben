    "# Conversation with CodeAct Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "CodeAct agent is an agent that not only chats but also writes and executes Python code for you.\n",
    "More details can be found in the project's related [github repo](https://github.com/xingyaoww/code-act). In the example here, we implement the CodeAct agent, and provide a simple example of how to use the CodeAct agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Follow [README.md](https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope) to install AgentScope. We require the latest version, so you should build from source by running `pip install -e .` instead of installing from pypi. \n",
    "- Prepare a model configuration. AgentScope supports both local deployed model services (CPU or GPU) and third-party services. More details and example model configurations please refer to our [tutorial](https://doc.agentscope.io/build_tutorial/model.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "- The example is tested with the following models. For other models, you may need to adjust the prompt.\n",
