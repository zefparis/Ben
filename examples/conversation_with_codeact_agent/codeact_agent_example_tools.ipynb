    "# Conversation with CodeAct Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "CodeAct agent is an agent that not only chats but also writes and executes Python code for you.\n",
    "More details can be found in the project's related [github repo](https://github.com/xingyaoww/code-act). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following CodeAct agent example, we demonstrate another method of empowering the agent with the capability to invoke tools, specifically by directly providing the agent with the corresponding code for the tools and then allowing the agent to utilize them independently.\n",
    "In term of tool usage, ReAct agent also enables the agent to use tools to solve problems, but in a different way. You can refer to the [ReAct agent](https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope/blob/main/examples/conversation_with_react_agent/main.ipynb) example for more details and compare the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Follow [README.md](https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope) to install AgentScope. We require the latest version, so you should build from source by running `pip install -e .` instead of installing from pypi. \n",
    "- Prepare a model configuration. AgentScope supports both local deployed model services (CPU or GPU) and third-party services. More details and example model configurations please refer to our [tutorial](https://doc.agentscope.io/build_tutorial/model.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "- The example is tested with the following models. For other models, you may need to adjust the prompt.\n",
